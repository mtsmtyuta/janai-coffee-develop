    "concept_bar_description": "In 1920s America, Prohibition was in full swing. Bars hid behind façades—barbershops, law offices, and the like—giving rise to the wildly popular “speakeasy” culture.\n \n JANAI COFFEE adopts that speakeasy spirit to create a hideaway for those who find the concept intriguing.(And yes, everything here is perfectly legal—rest assured.)",
